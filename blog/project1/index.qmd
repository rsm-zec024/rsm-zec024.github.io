## 🎮 Project Overview

This project builds a predictive model for **Creative Gaming’s** mobile title *Space Pirates*. The business goal is to identify players most likely to buy the premium **Zalon campaign** and evaluate how in-app ads and modeling strategies influence campaign performance.

We use telemetry data for over 200,000 users and analyze conversion rates, profits, and model performance across multiple targeting strategies.

---

## 📁 Data & Setup

- `cg_organic.parquet`: 30K players, organically converted or not
- `cg_organic_control.parquet`: 30K users, control group for ad experiment
- `cg_ad_treatment.parquet`: 150K users exposed to ads, tagged for random/model targeting
- Features include behavior (sessions, badges, roles), purchase history, and device info

---

## 🔍 Part I: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Organic conversion rate**: 5.75%
- **Histogram & frequency plots** created for all features
- Key variables include:
  - `NumGameDays`, `NumSpaceHeroBadges`, `NumAdsClicked`, `GameLevel`, `PurchasedCoinPackLarge`
- No missing data; variable ranges and distributions look appropriate for modeling

---

## 🤖 Part II: Logistic Regression Modeling

We trained a logistic regression model using the training set (`training == 1`). Model performance:

- **Top 5 Features**:
  - `NumSpaceHeroBadges` (+)
  - `NumFriendRequestIgnored` (-)
  - `TimesLostSpaceship` (-)
  - `GameLevel` (+)
  - `NumAdsClicked` (+)
- **AUC**:
  - Train: 0.820
  - Test: 0.803

> Interpretation: In-game engagement (badges, ad clicks) positively correlates with purchase behavior; social avoidance or in-game failure reduces likelihood.

## 📈 Part III: Evaluating the Ad Experiment

### 🎯 Experiment Groups (Each with 30,000 users)

| Group | Description                     | Conversion Rate | Profit      |
|-------|----------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| G1    | No ads (control)                | 5.69%            | \$25,572.94 |
| G2    | Random ad exposure              | 13.04%           | \$13,655.87 |
| G3    | Model-selected ad targeting     | 21.51%           | \$51,715.48 |

- **Ad lift** (G2 vs G1): +129%
- **Model lift** (G3 vs G2): +65%
- **ROI** from model-based targeting: +279%

---

## 🔁 Part IV: Retraining on Ad Response

Retrained logistic regression using ad-exposed users (G2). Compared predictions on G3 population:

- **AUC of “organic” model**: 0.644
- **AUC of new “ad” model**: 0.703

> Retraining on ad data improved accuracy in identifying ad-sensitive users.

## 🧠 Part V: Machine Learning Comparison

| Model              | AUC   | Conversion Rate | Profit       |
|-------------------|--------|------------------|--------------|
| Logistic (ad)     | 0.703  | 27.39%           | \$78,172.83  |
| Neural Network    | 0.780  | 30.99%           | \$94,377.02  |
| Random Forest     | 0.779  | 31.15%           | \$95,096.54  |

> Both ML models outperformed logistic regression. Neural network showed the highest AUC; random forest yielded the highest profit.

## 🧾 Conclusion

Ads significantly improve conversion and revenue for the Zalon campaign, and **targeted ad selection via machine learning yields the highest ROI**. Combining experimentation with modeling is key to unlocking profitable, data-driven decisions in mobile gaming.
